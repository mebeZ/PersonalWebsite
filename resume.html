              <p>My journey into Machine Learning started with curiosity, reading, and tinkering. I remember thinking WOW -- this is cool! The spark grew when I earned a spot in the Math & Computer Science research track at Bronx Science in the Fall 2017. And it reached full blaze in the Spring of 2018, when I began developing actual ML solutions for Dr. Jiook Cha at Columbia University. My MIT THINK Machine Learning-based proposal, prototype and presentation consumed Winter 2018/2019. But soon after, Spring of 2019, I thought, hey, how I can pay this forward. While a group of us had informally been doing ML Club-like activities since Fall of 2017, I thought making an effort to formalize the club might help future students. I also personally had a lot more to offer in terms of actual ML experience at that point. So during that time frame, Spring 2019, I began the process of getting the BXS Machine Learning Club formally recognized and booted-up. It was an involved process that required approximately six months and a number of administrative approvals, but ... SUCCESS! We are now the approved and formally recognized -- first-ever Bronx Science Machine Learning Club! 

                I have created version-1.0 of the club website. Please check us out here: <a href="https://bxsml.org" target="_blank">BXSML.org</a>.</p>

                <p>Help keep paddlers safe during weekly public kayaking sessions at <a href="https://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/park/pier-2" target="_blank">Pier 2</a>. Lead trips from Pier 2/Pier 4 to NYC destinations such as Redhook and Hunters Point. Help out in whatever capacity is needed.</p>
                <p>I have volunteered at BBPB since I was ten years old and have developed a love for kayaking and the outdoors. On some weekday nights (Thursdays) and weekends, we facilitate a free public paddling program at Pier 2. Since 2012 I have served as a safety boater for this program. I have helped hundreds of people experience kayaking for the first time, while keeping them safe on the water. I am grateful for the opportunity to serve the NYC community and provide people with a really healthy experience.
                <p>I also lead kayaking trips for other volunteers. I am the youngest trip leader in the organization, having excelled in rigorous skills training sessions and passing First Aid & CPR certification in order to qualify. In my training, I learned how to perform self & assisted rescues, communicate over VHF radio, put a kayaker on tow, assess wind, tidal currents, and other weather conditions while planning for a trip. Since I was approved as a trip leader this summer, I have successfully lead trips to NYC destinations like Redhook & Hunters Point.</p>
