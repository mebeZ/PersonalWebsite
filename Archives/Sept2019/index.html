        <p>Hello! I am Zach, a senior at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science" target="_blank">Bronx Science</a> interested in computer science and pursuing scientific research.
        </p>
        <p>I am the founder and president of the <a href="https://bxsml.org/" target="_blank">Bronx Science Machine Learning Club</a>  and I occasionally opine on Deep Learning topics on <a href="https://perceptron.zacharyhine.com/" target="_blank">Perceptron</a>.</p>
        <p>Since 2018, I've been working with <a href="https://childadolescentpsych.cumc.columbia.edu/faculty/jiook-cha" target="_blank">Dr. Jiook Cha</a> in the Posner Lab at Columbia University where I have levered my passion for advanced math and machine learning to contribute to two really interesting research projects: 1) Create an algorithm to better analyze four-dimensional fRMI data and improve prescription efficacy for patients suffering from depression.  2) Examine complex brain imaging data in novel ways to better understand the effects of chronic stress on the HPA axis in humans.
        </p>
        <p>During my junior year of high school, I wrote a research proposal and created a software prototype to help identify xerophthalmia, a progressive eye disease caused by vitamin A deficiency; prominent in developing countries. I leveraged my related work at Columbia University and my knowledge of Machine Learning to create a software solution that, when fully financed, could scale to help the scarcity of trained health professionals currently working in this area. The proposal and prototype earned the top semifinalist award at the 2018/19 annual MIT THINK competition.   
        </p>
        <p>When not on the computer, I volunteer at <a href="http://www.bbpboathouse.org/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Bridge Park Boathouse</a> serving as a safety boater and a trip leader. Other than kayaking, I enjoy reading, hiking, and listening to podcasts.
